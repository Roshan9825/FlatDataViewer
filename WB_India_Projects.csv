India’s social protection architecture stands at an important crossroad, poised to transform from a set of siloed schemes to a more coordinated and context-specific system. While India has multiple programs to provide support and the recent Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) has been critical in this set-up, mission-mode expansion of coverage will require an overarching body which monitors, strategizes and guides how various innovations, centre and state agencies, schemes, staff and budgets will be coordinated to ensure adequate social protection coverage for the poor and vulnerable. Meeting the diverse needs of states requires an overhaul in India’s social protection financing and delivery architecture. This is critical to ensure centre and state consolidate delivery costs, avoid administrative duplication and respond to India’s diverse and changing risk profile. The development policy financing focusses on these key structural reforms through four pillars : (1) fostering deeper devolution to states to use resources for local needs/risks and disasters; (2) expanding the social protection net for underserved urban informal workers; (3) strengthening delivery of existing new initiatives through focus on improved methods for targeting and payments; and (4) climate action reforms to build adaptation and mitigation capacities for the most vulnerable.'}"

Growth has accelerated in the last two quarters to reach 8.2 percent in the first quarter of FY18-2019. This growth was supported by a revival in industrial activity, strong private consumption, and a rise in exports of goods and services. At the same time, the external situation has become less favorable. The current account balance has widened on the account of an increasing trade deficit (on the back of strong import demand and higher oil prices) from 0.7 percent of GDP in FY16-17 to 1.9 percent in FY17-18. Meanwhile, external headwinds, monetary policy ‘normalization’ in the US coupled with recent stress in some Emerging Market Economies, have triggered portfolio outflows from April 2018 onwards, putting additional pressure on the balance of payments. Going forward, growth is projected to reach 7.3 percent in FY18-19 and to firm up thereafter at around 7.5 percent, primarily on account of robust private and public consumption expenditure, a rise in exports of goods and services, and a gradual increase in investments. However, the current account deficit is also projected to remain elevated in FY18-19. Between FY2011-12 and 2015, poverty declined from 21.6 percent to an estimated 13.4 percent at the international poverty line (2011 PPP US dollar 1.90 per person per day), continuing the earlier trend of robust reduction in poverty. Aided by robust economic growth, more than 90 million people escaped extreme poverty and improved their living standards during this period. Despite this success, poverty remains widespread in India. In 2015, with the latest estimates, 176 million Indians were living in extreme poverty while 659 million, or half the population, were below the higher poverty line commonly used for lower middle-income countries (2011 PPP US$3.20 per person per day). Recent trends in the construction sector and rural wages, a major source of employment for the poorer households, suggest that the pace of poverty eradication may have slowed. India is still marked by disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as structural inequalities by gender, tribe, and caste. Addressing these inequalities will require increasing access, quality, and utilization of human development services, including health care.'}"

India is among the world’s fastest growing economies and has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction and human development. Wide-ranging and ongoing macroeconomic, fiscal, tax and business environment reforms have enabled rapid growth. Already the third largest economy in the world in purchasing parity terms, the country is expected to grow at over 7 percent a year in coming years. Over the past thirty years, per capita incomes quadrupled, poverty retreated, illiteracy rates dropped, and health-related statistics improved. India’s extreme poverty rate halved from 46 percent to 21 percent in the two decades up to 2011. While growth in India has been impressive, it needs to be equally shared; India faces social, institutional and policy challenges. To meet the development goals, India needs to adapt its institutions to improve public sector performance and deliver services effectively to its citizens. Improvements in service delivery requires improvements in accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness along the chain from inputs to outcomes. Competition between states is part of a new dynamic to incentivize change, using funding to hold states accountable for progress based upon their own priorities. India has a federal, three-tier structure of Government comprising the national or Union level; states; and districts. The fiscal relationship between the Union and the States is reflected in revenue sharing, devolution of central taxes and assistance in the form of grants. Recent policy level changes at the Union level, have increased the share of Union resources devolved to the states, reduced the share of resources through tied transfers under Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and introduced a Goods and Service Tax (GST) that is expected to contribute to growth in state revenues. In the medium term, increases in untied resources are expected to result in states managing nearly 60 percent of total public expenditure. The move toward increased expenditure flexibility for states presents both an opportunity and challenge. The opportunity lies in the greater freedom to align local development needs and priorities with the resources available. The challenge lies in the development of robust public financial management systems that can allocate and deliver resources in line with policy priorities.'}"

This DPL, the first of three, supports the implementation of the GoHP’s medium-term program for improving Water Supply and Sewerage (WSS) services, starting with the Greater Shimla Area. This marks a departure from the traditional short-term crisis handling approach of the past in Himachal Pradesh’s Water Supply and Sewerage WSS sector. To achieve the Project Development Objective (PDO), the operation supports three key pillars of the government program: (i) Improving governance, managerial and financial autonomy; (ii) Increasing the efficiency of WSS operations; (iii) Increasing customer orientation and accountability, complemented by a cross-cutting capacity building effort. This program is consistent with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY18-22. The CPF focuses on a more resource-efficient growth path for India, in which improving living conditions and sustainability of cities through improving water systems is a direct contributor. The program directly contributes to the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. This DPL is supporting public sector reforms, including improving operational and financial sustainability of services through an autonomous and accountable WSS Company and thus strengthening the capacity of Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC) and GoHP to improve services. This will improve the credit-worthiness of Shimla Jal Prabandhan Nigam Limited (SJPNL) and enhance the chances of future private financing.'}"

This operation will support the comprehensive reform program, developed by the Government of India (GoI) and the State government that will improve the performance of the electricity distribution utilities of Rajasthan. The loan will be the first in a programmatic series of two operations and consists of an IBRD loan of US$250 million. During the previous decade, Rajasthan’s economy grew at 7.9 percent and poverty declined more rapidly than the national average. Electric power sector in Rajasthan has expanded and improved over time, but is now facing serious financial challenges5 that threaten the sustainability of supply going forward. The operation focuses on institutional and operational reforms of the distribution utilities of Rajasthan aiming to restore the viability of the power sector. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India FY13-17 focuses on assisting low income states, such as Rajasthan, while recognizing the importance of good quality electricity services to enable economic growth and fight poverty. A reformed power sector will require lower fiscal subsidies in the medium-term and result in reduced contingent liabilities that will create fiscal space for more poverty-targeted interventions.

Poverty reduction was supported by higher economic growth and greater responsiveness of poverty to growth, including through the expansion of social programs. Increases in non-farm wage employment, especially in construction, greater rural-urban integration, and higher rural wage growth were amongst the key drivers. However, in the more recent period since 2012, a slowdown in rural real wage growth and volatility in construction activity may have had a sobering effect on the pace of poverty reduction. At the same time, acceleration of growth to 7.3 percent in 2015, if sustained, may lead to further gains for the poor. Maintaining the growth momentum, and increasing the responsiveness of poverty reduction to growth, is an India’s key challenge going forward. The overall experience of the past national sanitation programs offer several lessons. First, eliminating OD will not be achieved through a top-down approach of constructing toilets. Instead, it needs to be driven by changing behavior at the community level. This requires complementary ‘soft’ interventions such as interpersonal communication of hygiene messages. Second, the implementation of SBM-G is being conducted by the states, and therefore the role of MDWS is to support states with allocation of funds and incentives for achievement of programs goals and objectives. This role is proposed to be expanded to provide additional capacity building and technical support to the implementing institutions in the states. Third, by recognizing and incentivizing good performance of states and their implementing agencies, especially GPs, fiscal programs should intelligently provide incentives to those implementing the program and who are key facilitators in achieving and sustaining the success of SBM-G. In order to implement an operation of national scale, a hybrid operation is proposed using two lending instruments: (a) Program for Results (PforR), for results orientation and supporting the incentive component of the national program; and (b) Investment Project Financing (IPF), for program management and capacity building at the national level.'}"

India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the last decade, but its economy now shows signs of slowing down. Between 2004 and 2011, a period that includes the global financial crisis, India's growth averaged 8.3 percent per year. Expanding social programs lowered the poverty rate by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2004-09, double the rate of the preceding decade. India's growth rate however slipped to a decade low of 5 percent in 2012-13 due to a combination of domestic and external factors, including high inflation, high fiscal deficit and weak external demand for the country's exports. This slowdown carries high social costs for millions of Indians, and threatens the gains made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Under its current 10-year RWSS program, Government of Maharashtra (GoM) seeks to significantly expand the frontiers in the sector with a focus on increasing house connection coverage, ensuring continuous water supply with adequate pressure and minimum quality standards, and ensuring that 100 percent of the rural population has access to safe water and basic sanitation. However, delivering this vision requires building capacities of institutions through appropriate implementation and management models. Maharashtra is also a rapidly urbanizing state with many large villages (each with a population of more than 10,000 people) and a growing number of peri-urban areas that are demanding higher levels of service.

An important part of the overall stimulus program is the provision of capital support to public sector banks (PSB). This will help maintain the confidence of the public in the banking sector, prevent shortages of capital from leading to a slowdown in credit growth, and provide a capital buffer to public sector banks to absorb the possible increase in non-performing assets (NPA) resulting from the global financial crisis and its impact on India's economy. India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowed from a peak 9.7 percent in 2006-07 to about 5-6 percent in the third and fourth quarters of 2008-09, and is projected to remain in the 5.5-6.5 percent range in 2009-10, a sharp drop with adverse implications for employment and poverty reduction, and on investment for long-term growth. The first BSSL will address needs arising from the current economic slowdown. Continued credit expansion by the banking system will complement the comprehensive stimulus measures that the Government has put in place since mid-2008, which include monetary, trade, fiscal, and financial sector actions, and will limit the slowdown before it becomes too deep.""}"

This project anticipates increased innovation and efficiency in the sector by: promoting community participation and ownership, sourcing of a cost-effective innovative water system technology, providing education and training programs on health and hygiene for the community, and fostering public-private partnerships. Enhancing the sustainability of pilot water projects in villages in AP has been a key part of the project design. The scheme provides a one-off subscription subsidy linked to the provision of clean water and these subsidy payments are largely made after the delivery of agreed outputs. These outputs include three months of billed user fee consumption. The Output-Based Aid (OBA) pilots require that tariffs paid by users for consumption should cover operation and maintenance costs, user-fee collection costs, and loan repayment. This requirement helps to ensure that the project is sustainable in the long-term without subsidies. It is anticipated that lessons learned and methodology developed for each Community Safe Water Scheme (CSWS) can readily be applied to other villages in the State of AP and ultimately in the whole of India. Naandi is confident that scaling up is possible as the demonstration effects of each pilot will motivate adjoining villages to engage in similar projects and increase their willingness to pay for water through user fees. In such a scenario, with prior approval from the pilot village, the water treatment facility benefits could be extended to the adjoining villages. Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) will help Naandi leverage its experiences of bringing safe water to villages, across India.'}"

Halving the proportion of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger is possible by 2015 if AP is able to sustain the achievements of the 1990s. Although poverty has declined in AP, the reduction is smaller than in other Indian states, particularly when compared with the other Southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and the pace of poverty reduction has been relatively slower in rural areas. In order to meet its poverty reduction goals, the challenge for AP is to improve the access of the poor to credit and social services (particularly, health and education), especially in rural areas. The goal of universal primary enrollment by 2015 is likely to be met, but achieving the targeted completion and retention rates will be a challenge. There has been progress towards gender equality in the labor market and in education, but targeted interventions are clearly necessary in order to eliminate the gender gap in education. Despite its recent efforts in improving school enrollments, the state continues to lag behind other states in literacy and education outcomes. Moreover, there are significant disparities across location, gender, income group and social category. The state is making efforts to address these problems. In the health sector, the challenges are even bigger. The state is on track to achieve its target of reducing maternal mortality to three-quarters of its 1990 level by 2015, and the goal of halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water is also likely to met. Despite the very clear emphasis on health outcomes in Vision 2020 , however, the sector lacks a clear focus on outcomes and would benefit from a more focused strategy. The major health status indicators are worse in AP than in comparator southern states, and in some cases improvement seems to have stalled. Meeting the goal of reducing child mortality rates to two-thirds of the 1990 level by 2015 is unlikely given the rate of progress to date.
